## 📚 Learnings
- Importance of the **staging area** in Git and how it controls what actually gets committed.  
- How branching keeps changes separate from the main project, and the mistakes that can happen when changes aren’t committed first.  
- Regex basics in Python and applying them to real input validation.  
- Reinforced my understanding of **version control** as more than just saving files — it’s about collaboration and history.
