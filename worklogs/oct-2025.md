## ðŸŽ“ Project: Django-Based Student Study Portal
**Progress Summary:**  
This month, I finalized my Django project and handled several backend improvements around error handling, exception control, and app integration.  

### âœ… Key Accomplishments:
- Implemented full **error and exception handling** across modules (`wiki`, `books`, and `notes`).
- Debugged file upload issues and improved how **student-submitted files** are stored.
- Added **image upload** support for notes, allowing students to share visual study materials.
- Improved template inheritance (`base.html`) and **dynamic alert rendering** for better UX.
- Worked on linking multiple apps properly via `{% url %}` in dropdown menus.
- Enhanced understanding of **OOP principles** and both **implicit and explicit** exception handling in Python/Django.
- Completed my **final year project** earlier than expected ðŸŽ‰.

### ðŸ’» Learning & Growth:
Alongside this, I officially started the **ALX Cybersecurity course** â€” learning about system vulnerabilities, secure data handling, and the fundamentals of ethical hacking.

### ðŸ§© Next Steps:
- Final project submission & defense.
- More practical application of cybersecurity skills to backend systems.
- Explore CI/CD for project deployment.
